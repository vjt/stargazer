This is an embryo, a work in progress, for a Ruby software allowing
you to control your Digital Single-Lens Reflex camera for long-time
exposure (using serial cables or gphoto), set parameters, download
shots and carry out focusing (using the pinpoint algorithm).

This is very pre-alpha as of now - stay tuned.
